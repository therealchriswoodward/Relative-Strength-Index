Creative data science for business solutions.

## Scenario:

A property owner who lists vacation rentals hires me to help them with pricing strategy. My job is to identify with precision when the "busy times" are.

# In This Project:

I use arbitrary data to calculate and plot a Relative Strength Index (RSI).

The RSI is commonly used in analyzing price action on the stock market, but you could also use it to monitor sales trends. In the case of this project, as percent increases and percent losses in performance happen naturally over time the oscillator will capture this momentum allowing me and my hypothetical propery owner to catch "busy time" trends as they emerge rather than after they emerge like my hypothetical propery owner's unfortunate competition. Prices can be adjusted incrementally to attempt to folow the trend more precisely or just at the will of my hypothetical property owner.

A complex problem solved with precision in a simple way.
